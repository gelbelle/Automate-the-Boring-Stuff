# Playing and Learning with Python
These files are the result of working through Al Sweigart's book, Automate the Boring Stuff with Python.
I fell in love with this book and really enjoyed working with and building on the examples and practice projects he provides.

I decided to start documenting my journey through the book, what I did and why on Medium. In case anyone was interested I decided to link to this repo.
I don't think there's anything earth shattering here, but if people find it interesting then I'm happy to share. Maybe it will even help some people. :)

So, here's my code.

I realize that right now my documentation isn't great. That's definitely next on my todo list. In my opinion code should always be documented whether 
anyone else will read it or not. Clearly I don't listen that well, even to my own good advice. It will prioritize it now that I'm actively sharing and hopefully 
no one will even see this note before I document and remove it.
